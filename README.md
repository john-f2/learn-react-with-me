# Project Task
* **Build/Re-create this simple form page in React**
* Learn how to build React Components, useStates and Effects, modern JS, css styling 
* **Output the results of the form submit to the console or text file**
* Don't worry about styling, just focus on the form text and fields first. Just do your best on making it look nice for now, you **don't** need to copy the design identically 
* Dont use a react framework, build all the components from scratch 
* (you should use commit emojis https://github.com/cooperka/emoji-commit-messages)!!!
